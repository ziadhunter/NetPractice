# NetPractice

## Description

NetPractice is a networking training project from the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to understand and practice **basic computer networking concepts** through interactive exercises.

In this project, we configure small networks by correctly setting:
- IP addresses
- Subnet masks
- Default gateways
- Routing behavior

The training is divided into **10 levels**, each one increasing in difficulty.  
All exercises are done using a **web-based interface**, without writing any code.

This project helps build a strong foundation in how networks work internally and how devices communicate with each other.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

1. Open your web browser.
Launch the NetPractice interface by opening the file:
[index.html](./index.html)

Open this file locally in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

3. Complete each level by correctly configuring the network elements.
4. When a level is correct, **export the configuration** using the interface.

### Exporting Configurations

- After completing a level, export the configuration file.
- Each level generates **one exported file**.

### Submission Requirements

- You must submit **10 exported configuration files**.
- One file per level (Level 1 to Level 10).
- All exported files must be placed **at the root of the Git repository**.
- No extra folders are required.

### Networking Concepts Studied

This project covers the following networking fundamentals:

- TCP/IP model layers
- IPv4 addresses
- Subnet masks
- Network and host separation
- Default gateway
- Routers and switches
- Broadcast and network ranges
- Basic routing principles
- How devices communicate inside and outside a network

## Resources

Almost everything is clearly explained in this playlist.

### Use of AI

AI tools were used to:
- Help understand networking concepts
- Clarify subnetting and routing logic
- Rewrite explanations in a simpler way
- Organize documentation content

All configurations and answers were completed manually by the student.

## Notes

- This project does not require compilation or programming.
- A working web browser is sufficient.
- Accuracy and logical reasoning are required to validate each level.
